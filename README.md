# toronto-bikeshare
An in-depth data analysis on toronto bikeshare data for 2016

**Tasks completed so far:**
1. Analyzed Toronto Bikeshare open data from 2016 with 217,000+ data points using Python pandas, numpy, matplotlib in Jupyter notebooks
2. Preliminary data cleaning/pre-processing in Python 3 to normalize all date/time data which were in different formats
3. Organized and visualized time series data by month and type of rider (Casual/Member) to understand ridership variation through seasons using matplotlib and seaborn
4. Used data to train and test Linear Regression Algorithm using Scikit Learn to predict the trend of ridership through the year

**Tasks TODO:**
1. Do Multiple Linear Regression, bringing in many variables and checking what the ridership depends on based on these variables.
2. Solving co-linearity problems between the many independent variables
3. Select the best independent variables with highest correlation
4. Use and compare more machine learning algorithms: Decision trees, Random forests
5. Leverage Bayesian Inference Modeling to take in our existing models as Priors and come up with a Posterior distribution
6. MCMC sampling to find variation in the population parameters
